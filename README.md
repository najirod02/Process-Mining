# Exam projects

1) python project about variance of a log

2) analysis of a log trace using tools like disco, prom 

3) python project about predictions based on a log trace

More info can be found on the moodle page and its relative pdf file.

## Project 1
Need to compute the edit distance (how much the strings are different) for each possible pair (a lot actually!).
One way to try to speed up computation is to not compute the same pairs (the order is not important) and maybe try to use threading computations to carry on many more checkings.
